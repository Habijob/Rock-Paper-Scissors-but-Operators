======== INFORMATION =========

The game was written by me, Habijob, to help me learn Java's operator precendence.

You need JVM11 or higher to run it.

Click on the .jar file to open the game.



======== HOW TO PLAY =========

You are given two "cards" of operators.
Then choose correctly if the left operator precedes (beats) the right operator or not.

Have fun :^)
